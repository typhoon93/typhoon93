-🐾 **My Software Developer Journey**: I started getting interested in programming way way back in 2017. You can see some of the commits on my repos from then. During that time I was flirting with the idea of becoming a developer, back and forth. As such I have gone through a variety of courses throughout the years. I would like to think they were all a preparation for where I am headed now. In 2022 the stars aligned and I landed my first official developer position. About a year later I left, because PHP was not the language I was looking to advance my career in, and also it was the right time to focus on my own ideas. Currently, I am rocking some extremely fun projects, and lots and lots of stuff lined up.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on OS ML projects that utilize Python.
